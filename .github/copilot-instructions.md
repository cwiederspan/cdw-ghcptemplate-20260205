## Non Negotiables
- **DO NOT store sensitive information** - Storing anything like API keys, secrets, passwords or certificates in clear text is strickly forbidden and would be exposed via Git or other prying eyes. Instead, use more secure methods like environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or GitHub Secrets as needed.
